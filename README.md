### About myself
I'm a very curious person and because of this I like to play around with a lot of programming languages...
I'm an Open Source enthusiast and i like to contribute where i can help..

Until now i've tried:
- Vanilla and Es6 Javascript/NodeJS/VueJS
- Python (v2.7 and 3.3+, i always use 3.6 or 3.9; unfortunately at work i had to use 2.7)
- Bash (v4+)
- HTML/CSS
- PHP (v7.4)
- AutoHotkey
- AutoIt
- C#
- Some more i didn't use much...
